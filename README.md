# Labyrinth Project 🐢

Labyrinth Project is a school Python project that generates and solves mazes using Turtle and Tkinter.

## 🚀 Features 
- User-friendly interface using Tkinter interface module.
- Manual resolution with keyboard control.
- Automatic resolution on a optimised path, with complex brute-force algorithm.
- Infinite random labyrinths generation.
- Manual choices of labyrinths from ".laby" files.
- Visualization of the solution of the maze using the Turtle graphics module.

## 💻 Installation
To install and run Labyrinth-Generator, you will need to have :
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Turtle package](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)
- [Tkinter package](https://docs.python.org/fr/3/library/tkinter.html)

## 🕹️ Usage
To use the script, simply run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
```python
python main.py
```
You will then be prompted to select a mode of resolution (manual or automatic) and to choose a labyrinth. Once the maze has been resolved, the solution will be displayed on screen.

## 🖼️ Example
Here is an example of a random generated maze resolved by the algorithm :
